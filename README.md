# CZ3007-Compiler-Techniques-Second-Laboratory-Assignment
The goal of this lab is to implement a parser for the programming language PL/3007. In the previous lab, you implemented a lexer, and in the next two labs you go through semantic analysis and code generation, so by the last lab you will have a full, working compiler from PL/3007 to Java bytecode. As in the previous lab, this lab provides you with a preconfigured Eclipse workspace (downloadable as a zip file from the course website) to get you started. The workspace contains several supporting files, which you do not need to touch, and a main file containing the beginnings of a parser specification using Beaver. The workspace also contains a rudimentary unit test suite, which you are encouraged to use and extend to test your implementation. Your assignment will be graded by the instructors using a unit test suite, so it is imperative that the code you hand in compiles and behaves correctly.
